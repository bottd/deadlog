Base HP increased from 6725 to 12500 and growth reduced from 470 to 200.<br>\n- Reworked Rejuv reward from Mid Boss. No longer buffs troopers, reduces respawn time and buffs various stats. Upon death, 3 rejuv crystals fall to the ground (4 for subsequent midboss kills). Claiming one now grants you in place revive after 3s. If you already claimed one and claim another, it'll go to an ally (priority is closest allies first, then most recent dead allies). Dying with Rejuv no longer counts as a kill/death nor gives out bounties. While you have the Rejuv buff, you gain the following: +20% Max HP, +20% Fire Rate, and +15% Spirit Damage. Gaining the buff heals you to full and lasts up to 7 minutes.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Meleeing a mantling enemy no longer cancels their mantle, instead it applies 80% movement slow that ramps down to 20% over 2s.<br>\n- Adding a debuff that makes you climb ropes 40% slower for 4s after you've taken player damage. This debuff only exists when you're on a rope, and tapers off to 0% in the last 1s of the damage window.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Slight reduction to the amount of turning you can do while performing a heavy melee<br>\n- Light melee base damage reduced by 20% (except for Viscous, Calico and Bebop)<br>\n- Heavy Melee cooldown increased from 0.9s to 1.0s<br>\n- Heavy Melee cooldown when missing increased from 0.9s to 1.3s<br>\n- Parried stun duration is no longer reduced by debuff resistance<br>\n- Parry bonus damage is no longer melee specific, now affects all damage types (reduced from 35% to 30%)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Heroes now have different dash speeds (same distance, slower to get there). They are placed into 3 buckets to start, Bucket 1: +5%, Bucket 2: -5%, Bucket 3: -15%.<br>\n<br>\nBucket 1: Ivy, Haze, Holliday, Calico, Grey Talon, Paradox<br>\nBucket 2: Seven, Mirage, Lash, Yamato, Pocket, Viscous, Vyper, Warden, Vindicta, Sinclair, Wraith, Infernus, Lady Geist<br>\nBucket 3: Mo &amp; Krill, Abrams, Shiv, Dynamo, Bebop, Kelvin, McGinnis<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Removed the teleporters behind the Walkers<br>\n- After 20 minutes, trooper spawn time is reduced from 30s to 25s<br>\n- Trooper bounty growth reduced from 1.5 to 1.2<br>\n- Removed the bounce pads on top of the Nursery/Fish Market rooftop leading back to Mid.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Trooper ally split updated from 100/65/30/20/15/11% to 100/65/28/15/12/8%<br>\n- Breakables souls growth per minute reduced from 2.6 to 2.0<br>\n- Reduced comeback multipliers a bit<br>\n- Neutrals bounty increased by 15% (strong neutrals +25%)<br>\n- Medium Neutrals respawn rate increased from 360s to 420s (+17%)<br>\n- Strong Neutrals respawn rate increased from 480s to 600s (+25%)<br>\n<br>\n- Sinner's Sacrifice: Retaliate damage increased from 40 to 60<br>\n- Sinner's Sacrifice: Heavy melee end success bonus now grants 4 buffs rather than 3 (these also take a little longer to kill now due to the melee timing changes)<br>\n<br>\n- Hero bounties are now reduced based on the amount of players, similar to the trooper mechanic. (Means kills are less efficient/rewarding when its a big group, 1/2/3/4/5/6 players are 100/100/90/85/80/75% efficient)<br>\n<br>\n- Movespeed Slow when shooting reduced from -30% to -25%<br>\n- Side Walkers HP increased by 10%<br>\n- Objectives no longer have 20-25% Spirit Resistance<br>\n- The following abilities now do 50% damage to objectives: Last Stand, Storm Cloud, Hyper Beam, Heavy

min is still 85s)<br>\n- Update the Zipline Knockdown to make the players go straight down and not start the stun timer until they hit the ground<br>\n- Zipline knockoff stun duration reduced from 3s to 2.5s<br>\n- Added new UI indicator on HP for showing pending heal (affects things like Abram's passive)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>[ Weapon Items ]</b><br>\n<br>\n- Restorative Shot: Heal from NPC reduced
