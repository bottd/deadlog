Players can temporarily lose access to certain capabilities in the game. The controls include Matchmaking, Voice Chat, Text Chat, Pausing, and Reporting. The system for tracking is active now, however we will wait on most penalties for a few days as we review the results.<br>\n- There is now a low priority queue. The primary way to enter this is through abandoning games, but it can include other behavior. You must complete the required amount of games (escalates based on low priority frequency) to be able to return to using matchmaking normally.<br>\n- Regularly misreporting players will result in you losing the reporting function and may in some cases cause you to go into low priority as well.<br>\n<br>\n- New players that are queued solo will only match with other new players until they get 4 wins<br>\n- The lane allocation of 1-1-2-2- and 2-2-1-1 will no longer be a possible setup<br>\n- A 6 player party will no longer match against solo players.

In this update we have separated the behavior of these two modes to better serve different functions. The keys used for each of these modes can be swapped within Keybinds Settings.​</div><div>​</div><div>Scoreboard (TAB):​</div><div>- Enables cursor mode​</div><div>- Displays Scoreboard​</div><div>- Displays Damage Summary​</div><div>- Allows minimap ping and draw​</div><div>​</div><div>Extra Info (ALT):​</div><div>- No longer enables cursor mode​</div><div>- Quick-upgrade Abilities (ie. ALT+1) each of these can be individually remapped​</div><div>- Can now more easily map ALT as an Alternate Cast button​</div><div>- Displays extra information on HUD (ie.
