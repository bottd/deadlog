He's green.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/1722549138302-png.8597/\"><img src=\"https://project8-data.community.forum/attachments/8/8606-5e65b8fab4e5d8bfec0c89803747f777.jpg?hash=iAqrn-aLP0\" alt=\"1722549138302.png\"></a><br>\n<br>\n- Improved client performance<br>\n<br>\n- Reworked the Hero Builds system. Browsing and editing builds now happens within the Shop UI (accessible via Sandbox or during a normal game). You can create custom categories for items with unique names and descriptions that can be independently resized and positioned. The interface for browsing builds has also been improved, public builds will now be sorted by popularity (number of favorites). Old builds are incompatible with this system, so they won't be visible in this UI, but we'll have a console command we'll release soon that you can use to print out your older guides if you need them for reference.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/dl_builds-mp4.8588/\">View attachment dl_builds.mp4</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- North America (NA) servers have been moved from the west coast to closer to the middle of the country to make latency between east and west coast a little more even, as the majority of users are east coast now. The total average ping amongst all players will be lower as a result of this (a little higher for some and a lot lower for others).<br>\n- NA region testing times now start 1 hour earlier weekdays and weekends<br>\n<br>\n- Minimum hero roster requirement reduced from 4 to 3<br>\n<br>\n- Added Oceanic servers and matchmaking region. Testing times are displayed in the client<br>\n<br>\n- Added Teleporter icons on the minimap. The icons glow when you get close to them and pulse on the teleporter's exit location to show you the destination when you are about to enter it.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/dl_minimap_teleporter-mp4.8589/\">View attachment dl_minimap_teleporter.mp4</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- When using the underground tunnels, the primary minimap fades out and an underground map for that area shows you your path and the exit locations.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/dl_minimap_tunnels-mp4.8590/\">View attachment DL_minimap_tunnels.mp4</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Reworked the invite system in the client to streamline the process. Emails are no longer required, the users will now receive access directly through Steam and Discord/Forum access will be available through the client. The UI will now also group users into three categories: available to invite, already invited, and already have access. This new system will result in less invitations stuck in limbo, and any previous invites that have not already claimed the game will be granted through this system as well.<br>\n<br>\n- Hero Sandbox: Added an orb spawner for practicing last-hitting orbs<br>\n- Hero Sandbox: Added a dummy hero that patrols left and right to practice targeting<br>\n<br>\n- Added a checkbox on the startup development dialog to be able to choose to not show it again<br>\n<br>\n- Your vision through a Cosmic Veil is now based on your hero position rather than camera position<br>\n- Adjusted Zipline camera positions for various heroes to help with visibility<br>\n- Double tap threshold increased from 0.2s to 0.3s<br>\n- Fixed Candle Troopers near-death flash sometimes occurring while moving or doing other active animations<br>\n- Candle Trooper behind-wall HUD indicator now also shows near-death state<br>\n<br>\n- Fixed taking damage not interrupting teleporters<br>\n- Fixed clicking on the top bar or minimap to change spectate targets being unreliable<br>\n- Fixed Function keys (F1-F5) being broken recently and not spectating team mates<br>\n- Fixed various abilities not showing the cast preview correctly on the first use (Mini Turrets, Quantum Entanglement, etc)<br>\n- Fixed Paradox Swap sometimes putting players behind walls<br>\n- Fixed Lash's Ground Strike sometimes causing the hero to be stuck for the rest of the match<br>\n- Fixed Abrams' Charge and Siphon pings not playing the correct VO<br>\n- Fixed Walkers having a pause at the end of their Rocket Barrage<br>\n- Fixed multiple instances of \"Killing Blow\" in the Damage Report<br>\n- Temporarily disabled the audio reminder on being unable to damage the patron while the shrines are alive<br>\n- Fixed Spectral Wall forcing itself into the first ability slot if its cooldown is refreshed<br>\n- Changed camera to more closely track the followed hero angles when watching replays<br>\n- Player names no longer show up above hero's heads when in replay free-cam mode<br>\n- Increased post-game time by 1s<br>\n- Fixed upgrading abilities via hotkeys not working while dead<br>\n- Fixed dead player minimap icons showing over enemy players who are below street level and over shop icons<br>\n- Fixed various bugs with Infernus that caused significant lag<br>\n- Fixed Shrines not having collision<br>\n- Fixed crosshair sometimes being stuck hidden for Yamato after Flying Strike was interrupted<br>\n- Added a bunch of new Ivy lines including updated pings, kill lines, etc<br>\n- Improved mix clarity for game dialog<br>\n- Improved distinction between orb collect and orb deny sounds<br>\n- Fixed various cheat/debug commands being accessible<br>\n- Updated Pocket animations: New crouch walk and aim, updated slide animation, and new firing from slide animation.<br>\n- Updated Mo &amp; Krill Burrow start, duration, and end sounds<br>\n- Updated Mo &amp; Krill Combo sound<br>\n- Updated Mo &amp; Krill Sand Blast cast sound mix<br>\n- Updated Warden Alchemical Flask impact sounds<br>\n- Updated Warden Binding Word sound mix for teammates<br>\n- Updated Pocket Enchanted Satchel cast and delay sounds<br>\n- Added sleep status sound<br>\n- Updated Wraith zipline animations<br>\n- Fixed a bug with Urn that could cause you to be permanently silenced<br>\n- Fixed shop close sounds playing whenever the player enters the radius of a closed shop<br>\n- Added new visual effects for Lash's Ground Strike<br>\n- Improved ground impact effects for Ivy's True Form<br>\n- The client now culls more sounds when they are below a volume threshold<br>\n- The server no longer tells clients to play certain sounds when players and spectators are outside of audible range<br>\n- Shortened weapons and abilities volume attenuation over distance<br>\n- Fixed the console command zoom_sensitivity_ratio affecting both zoomed in and out<br>\n- Replaced two oil trucks with a new vehicle prop<br>\n- Improved visibility of low health state on troopers about to die<br>\n- Fixed Pocket's Cloak being able to tunnel through some ceilings and out of the world<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>[ Misc Gameplay ]</b><br>\n<br>\n- Reworked the location of the Walker on Amber Yellow and Sapphire Purple lanes.

Nearby terrain has been reworked as well.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/dl_yellow_changes-png.8591/\"><img src=\"https://project8-data.community.forum/attachments/8/8600-bec5521cea56fd07b5b4d9a10f29ec7f.jpg?hash=w44NZ_-AdQ\" alt=\"DL_Yellow_changes.png\"></a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- The shooting experience near corners has been improved. Previously if your hero's eyes were obstructed at all, you would be unable to shoot altogether even if a large portion of your body was clearly visible. The check will now be a little more sophisticated and custom per hero, to allow you to shoot if your body is reasonably exposed. A part of this will also involve your hero leaning out a bit if not enough of your model is exposed to enemies.<br>\n<br>\n- Soul Orbs now fly out in different initial directions before floating up. There is a 1/3rd chance it goes left, 1/3rd chance it goes right, and 1/3rd chance it goes up.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Teleporters are now in pairs that send you between them to traverse the map horizontally<br>\n- Removed outer lane teleporters<br>\n- Added teleporters to areas between lanes (one in each quadrant).
