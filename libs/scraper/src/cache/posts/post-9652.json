Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in China Standard Time (GMT+8).<br>\n<br>\n- Added South America servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in Atlantic Standard Time (GMT-4).<br>\n<br>\n- Added a new Damage Report feature. You can now open a flyout panel within the shop to view a breakdown of your hero's incoming and outgoing damage throughout the course of a match. You can also hover an enemy hero to view a quick breakdown of their key stats and items. The data can be filtered by last respawn, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minute, or 30 seconds.<br>\n<br>\n- Reworked the top bar HUD to reduce overall height<br>\n<br>\n- While spectating or watching replays, the game now has a free cursor mode without needing to hold modifiers down (defaulted to on).
