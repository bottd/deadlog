When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards. The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://forums.playdeadlock.com/attachments/two_buttons_abrams-png.20354/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://project8-data.community.forum/attachments/20/20367-5afd920938a15b06c92dbacbd525b980.jpg?hash=QQG9epHAYO\" class=\"bbImage \" style=\"\" alt=\"two_buttons_abrams.png\" title=\"two_buttons_abrams.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><br>\n<br>\n- Added global quickcast support.
