When you are stunned, you will lose control and continue towards the landing destination. The stun will wear off 0.2s after landing, and then a 30% slow for 2s will apply. Damage over time does not trigger this (same damage rules as ziplines).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n* Mystic Shot: Base damage reduced from 55 to 45<br>\n* Mystic Shot: Spirit scaling increased from 0.65 to 0.75<br>\n* Warp Stone: Bullet Resist reduced from 40% to 35%<br>\n* Capacitor: Fire Rate reduced from 8% to 5%<br>\n* Capacitor: Cooldown increased from 40s to 60s<br>\n* Guardian Ward: Cooldown increased from 40s to 45s<br>\n* Reactive Barrier: Cooldown increased from 24s to 26s<br>\n* Spirit Shielding: Barrier reduced from 325 to 300<br>\n* Spirit Shielding: Barrier boon scaling increased from 4 to 5<br>\n* Weapon Shielding: Barrier reduced from 325 to 300<br>\n* Weapon Shielding: Barrier boon scaling increased from 4 to 5<br>\n* Fortitude: Damage taken duration to regen reduced from 14s to 13s<br>\n* Trophy Collector: Souls per Minute increased from 25 to 30<br>\n* Majestic Leap: Cooldown increased from 28s to 32s<br>\n* Divine Barrier: Cooldown increased from 40s to 45s<br>\n* Rusted Barrel: Bonus health increased from 60 to 70<br>\n* Silence Wave: Cooldown increased from 30s to 35s (affects component)<br>\n* Spirit Snatch: Duration reduced from 14s to 10s<br>\n* Spirit Snatch: Bonus damage reduced from 75 to 50<br>\n* Ethereal Shift: Cooldown increased from 20s to 45s<br>\n* Ethereal Shift: Movespeed during phase reduced from 4m to 3m<br>\n* Ethereal Shift: Can no longer target an ethereal shifted ally with things like Rescue Beam, Viscous Cube, etc<br>\n* Curse: Cooldown reduced from 50s to 45s<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n* Calico: Gloom Bombs cooldown increased from 10s to 12s<br>\n* Calico: Gloom Bombs base damage from 55 to 45<br>\n* Calico: Gloom Bombs spirit scaling reduced from 0.74 to 0.64<br>\n* Calico: Gloom Bombs multi bomb damage ratio increased from 50% to 65%<br>\n* Calico: Ava no longer replenishes stamina on usage<br>\n* Doorman: Bullet damage growth per boon reduced from 1.15 to 1.0<br>\n* Doorman: Outgoing headshot damage multiplier reduced by 25%<br>\n* Doorman: Call Bell explosion damage spirit scaling increased from 1.5 to 1.7<br>\n* Drifter: Bloodscent isolated kill bonus reduced from 5% to 4%<br>\n* Drifter: Base bullet damage increased from 20.9 to 21.3<br>\n* Drifter: Bullet damage growth increased from 0.52 to 0.56<br>\n* Dynamo: Quantum Entanglement Fire Rate increased from +25% to +30%<br>\n* Dynamo: Rejuvenating Aurora cooldown reduced from 48s to 45s<br>\n* Infernus: Bullet damage growth per boon reduced from 0.12 to 0.08<br>\n* Infernus: Flame Dash T2 reduced from +35 to +30<br>\n* Infernus: Afterburn T1 reduced from -25% Spirit Damage to -20%<br>\n* Infernus: Afterburn T3 reduced from +28 DPS to +26<br>\n* Kelvin: Base regen reduced from 2 to 1<br>\n* Kelvin: Headshot reduction reduced from -20% to -25%<br>\n* Kelvin: Frozen Shelter cooldown increased from 150s to 170s<br>\n* McGinnis: Medicinal Specter now has a 1s linger time<br>\n* Paradox: Base bullet damage reduced from 6.48 to 6.15<br>\n* Paradox: Paradoxical Swap cooldown increased from 70s to 75s<br>\n* Seven: Lightning Ball spirit scaling increased from 0.43 to 0.55<br>\n* Shiv: Alt fire knockback reduced by 10%<br>\n* Victor: Pain Battery T1 and T2 swapped<br>\n* Victor: Aura of Suffering max damage reduced from 80 to 70<br>\n* Victor: Aura of Suffering T2 reduced from +10/50 to +8/40<br>\n* Vyper: Screwjab Dagger spirit scaling increased from 0.65/0.33 to 0.8/0.4<br>\n* Warden: Base bullet damage increased from 15 to 16.2<br>\n* Warden: Binding Word range increased from 19m to 20m</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"js-selectToQuoteEnd\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
