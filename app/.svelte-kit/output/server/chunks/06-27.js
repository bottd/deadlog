		"Added a hero based mmr system, so when you join a match with a specific hero the matchmaker adjusts the skill level it assumes you are at by a percentage up or down based on your experience and performance levels with that hero. Added settings option to allow weapon zoom to be a toggle Added a game volume slider which will control volume independently from voice chat (VoIP) General improvements to voice chat quality Non-matchmaking lobbies are now considered safe to abandon Crates now show the amount of souls they have in the tooltip Greater contrast between team and enemy sounds Updated headshot hit indicator Updated McGinnis weapon sounds Updated Vindicta weapon sounds Updated Lady Geist weapon sounds Fixed a bug where pinging Bebop's Hook and Sticky Bomb abilities would call the wrong ability name Fixed a recent bug with Metal Skin that caused you to do zero bullet damage Fixed a bug with releasing Grey Talon's Owl early Updated Dynamo's animation while using Rejuvenating Aurora Fixed a bug that could allow Grey Talon to hit the same target multiple times when close during Rain of Arrows Fixed a bug that could cause button input detection to malfunction Fixed an issue where the Rejuvenator being stolen was firing incorrectly Fixed a bug introduced in last week's update that caused gun spreads to not work properly Added an effect at the bottom of a player's screen whenever they are standing on something that causes damage Improved Abrams animation while hovering in the air during his ultimate and adjusted the downward acceleration animation Flex slot removed from killing the Patron and added to killing all Walkers Urn now spawns on both sides of the map. Bounty for each is reduced by 40% Rejuvenator now reduces players' next respawn time by 75% instead of giving a 3s respawn time Golden Statues no longer drop powerups (time duration buffs). Instead they now drop small permanent bonuses. These stack and do not decay with time or death. Drop rates rebalanced. At defined locations around the map, powerups now spawn starting 10 minutes (and every 5 minutes after). There are 6 spots where they spawn and they are indicated on the minimap when they are up. Movement powerup duration increased from 30s to 50s Fire Rate powerup duration increased from 35s to 45s and +15% Fire Rate to +18% Regeneration powerup duration increased from 25s to 45s Stamina powerup duration increased from 80s to 120s Cooldown powerup is unchanged Clip powerup is unchanged Breakables initial spawn time increased from 2 min to 3 min Fixed being able to hide inside the Guardian's head Jumping after a dash jump no longer causes your hero to sometimes jump in place Breakables souls base value reduced by 30%. Increases to +15% of current values over 30 minutes. (so -30% to +15% from start to 30 min) All hero guns' reload time reduced by 5% Zipline Boost ability cooldown reduced from 380s to 340s Medic Trooper heal now bounces to up to one other allied hero within 25m from the hero Trooper gold sharing radius from the location of the allied hero reduced from 50m to 40m Creep waves now land at their lane destinations at the same time as each other Added connection hallway between outer lane Shop and crate room Opened up Authority Building and Jazz Club to the Guardian side Added intermediate cover in front of Amber Orange Guardian and Sapphire Blue Guardian Added Veils to entrances to base fountain Extended cover near Sapphire Orange Guardian to match Amber Blue Extended alcove on outer lane cover position in front of the Shop Underground tunnels have more light Removed underground tunnel alcoves Added signs for entrance to the underground tunnel from the warehouse side Withering Whip: Ammo increased from 15% to 20% Withering Whip: Now grants +4 Spirit Dynamo Quantum Entanglement is prevented from being cast when Dynamo is rooted or movement-silenced (such as by Slowing Hex) Rejuvenating Aurora T3 reduced from +5% to +4% Haze Bullet Dance T1 increased from +5 Weapon Damage to +6 Fixed various bugs with the fire rate on Bullet Dance (net effect of the bugs was that it often fired a little faster than it was intended to) Infernus Afterburn base dps reduced from 20 to 18 Afterburn T3 reduced from +35 to +33 Kelvin Arctic Beam spirit scaling increased from 0.7 to 0.9 Arctic Beam cooldown reduced from 25 to 23 Lash Ground Strike radius reduced from 14m to 13m Death Slam radius reduced from 20m to 19m McGinnis Fixed her gun having a recent regression that caused it to not have any spread Mini Turret damage reduced by up to 30% at 35m (now has bullet falloff from 20m to 35m) Mini Turret deploy time reduced from 2s to 1s Mini Turret now shows up on the minimap Medicinal Spectre can no longer be attacked Spectral Wall height increased by 2m Spectral Wall slow duration increased from 2s to 2.5s Fixed a bug with Spectral Wall that caused the Rejuvenator to instantly drop Mo & Krill Base HP regen increased from 2.5 to 3 Scorn damage increased from 50 to 60 Fixed Scorn not healing for more with things like Mystic Burst Burrow now destroys breakables in its path Fixed Healing Booster not applying to Scorn's 2x heal multiplier on heroes Added a bonus counter to show how much health has been earned by getting a kill during Combo Paradox Base movement speed reduced from 7 to 6.5 Kinetic Carbine impact radius reduced by 15% Kinetic Carbine Max Stop Duration reduced from 0.75 to 0.5 Kinetic Carbine buff duration reduced from 6 to 4 Kinetic Carbine T1 increased from +0.5s Max Stop Duration to +0.75 Kinetic Carbine T2 now also increases buff by +2s Paradoxical Swap range reduced from 35m to 30m Pocket Enchanter's Satchel can now be canceled by shooting Seven Fixed Return Fire working with Power Surge No longer has base +15% Spirit Resistance Now has base +20% Bullet Resistance Base health regen reduced from 2 to 1 Static Charge T1 improved from -15s Cooldown to -20s Vindicta Base movement speed increased from 7 to 8 Fixed Crow Familiar T1 only bouncing to 1 additional target instead of 2 Assassinate zoom level is reduced a bit Warden Willpower no longer loses movement speed when the shield is depleted Willpower duration reduced from 8s to 7s Wraith The Royal Flush ability has been replaced with Card Trick.
