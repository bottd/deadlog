content_text: "Added Asia servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in China Standard Time (GMT+8). Added South America servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in Atlantic Standard Time (GMT-4). Added a new Damage Report feature. You can now open a flyout panel within the shop to view a breakdown of your hero's incoming and outgoing damage throughout the course of a match. You can also hover an enemy hero to view a quick breakdown of their key stats and items. The data can be filtered by last respawn, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minute, or 30 seconds. Reworked the top bar HUD to reduce overall height While spectating or watching replays, the game now has a free cursor mode without needing to hold modifiers down (defaulted to on). Can toggle it off while spectating using the 'J' key. Minimap now displays dead heroes for 5 seconds after their death Reworked the default suggested items for heroes to be much more simple (oriented more strongly for new player onboarding) Parties will now be a little more likely to be in the same lane, if there isn't a wide skill gap or other factors preventing it All instances of collecting souls  (whether claiming your own or denying an opponent) will share the same sound. Being denied a soul orb by an enemy will have its own unique sound. Fixed the HUD cooldown state thrashing while picking up the Soul Urn Fixed Spectral Wall sometimes not spawning depending on the map geometry nearby Added descriptive tooltips to Render and Audio options within settings. Render tooltips include an estimate of performance impact where applicable. Fixed a bug where bullets could penetrate close range targets and hit 2 targets when not intended (was primarily obvious with neutral farming) Reduced the end of match delay from 10s to 4s Added a shatter sound effect for meleeing the mid boss rejuvenator Added ghost models inside the doorways of the juke closets to help clarify which are dead ends Fixed position of the \"All Walkers Destroyed\" Flex slot to be the 2nd slot rather than the 4th Added a sound for when Infernus's Afterburn procs Added rejuvenator pickup sound Minimap now highlights Soul Urn dropoff location Updated Wraith Full Auto cast sound Added audio feedback for environmental damage Fixed sounds associated with last hit playing unreliably Updated sounds for Wraith Card Trick projectile, impact, and when you gain a card Added traffic and construction ambient sounds and updated general ambience mix Urn count changed from 2 to 1 (previous souls value restored) Urn pickup location moved to closer to the outer lanes (on the opposite side of the lane pillar, facing towards the bridge) Urn drop-off location now move to the same spot as the pickup (opposite end of the map, depending on which location the Urn spawns in) Urn pickup time reduced from 4s to 2s Urn now has a 2s drop-off time Urn no longer applies a 15% slow Urn now prevents you from using the zipline while carrying it The person delivering the urn now gets +25% soul bonus Reworked how Powerups work. There are now only 2 locations where they spawn instead of 6 (the two at the strong camps near the middle far edges of the map). The different powerup types are reduced from 6 to 4 and they have been reworked: Powerups now always cycle which ones spawn until they have each spawned, and then they are randomly allocated again Base Guardians and Shrines now have +40% Bullet Resistance. They lose 20% for each enemy hero nearby (down to a minimum of 0% bullet resistance). When they haven't taken damage for 60 seconds, they regenerate 4% max hp per second. Fixed Walkers not using their stomp properly Troopers now deal 25% less damage to other troopers Troopers spawn rate before 10 minutes is now the same as after 10 minutes (30s->25s) Breakables are no longer pre-placed on the map, they now spawn in when they are able to roll for drops (3 minutes) Breakables now use pseudorandom rolls (makes streaks of success or failure less likely) Golden Statue bonuses now have some dynamic weighting based on what has already dropped (makes it less likely that you have too many of one specific bonus over the course of the game) Golden Statue's CD Reduction bonus increased from 0.5% to 0.75% After 25 minutes, the Golden Statue bonuses that drop are slightly stronger: Bullet falloff damage now starts at 25m instead of 27m Inner lane Walker arena (Amber
