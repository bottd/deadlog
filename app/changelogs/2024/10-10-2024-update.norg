content_text: "Added Ranked mode Added a 3rd casting mode, Quick Cast (shows range/radius/etc on key down, then on key up acts like Instant Cast). The three casting modes are now Instant Cast, Quick Cast, and Confirm Cast.

You can click on it to copy the Build ID to the clipboard to share specific builds with friends. If you enter a Build ID in the search box of the build browser, it will show all of the builds for the current hero by the author of that build.
